# About the project
This project was developped as part of my Algorithmic Techniques for AI course over the Fall 2023 semester along with my teammate.
The aim was to implement a Genetic Algorithm that could solve a 4 x 4 sudoku within seconds and a 9 x 9 within a minute.
Genetic Algorithms are a very interesting way of solving problems. Using this technique, the solution space is treated as a population in which each individual's fitness can be assessed. The fittest individuals are selected and made to reproduce, forming children. The children are then mutated with hopes of increasing their fitness levels by introducing randomness at the genotypic level. The children now form the new generation.

 This cycle is repeated until the termination condition is reached.
